# Kotlin open questions

- Do primitive array types actually make a difference? How important is it in Kotlin development (or more concretely, mobile development) to use an `IntArray` over a standard array
- How often are keywords like `tailrec`, `inline` even used? Do performance demands ever require this level of tuning?
- There are a lot of performance-related keywords like `val x: String by lazy`. How important is this?
